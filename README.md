# Fraud Buster API Integration Example

Welcome to the official integration example for the **Fraud Buster API** by **Hive Forensics AI Inc.** This guide is designed to help developers seamlessly implement our cutting-edge fraudulent transaction detection within their payment forms.

## Overview

The Fraud Buster API provides real-time transaction risk assessment to help prevent fraudulent activities in your payment systems. This React-based example demonstrates how to integrate our API into your frontend applications, enhancing security and user trust.

## Features

- Real-time risk score assessment based on transaction details.
- Dynamic response handling to guide user actions.
- Easy-to-implement React hooks for quick integration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic understanding of React and JavaScript.
- An API key from Hive Forensics (obtainable through [our website](https://hiveforensics.com)).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HiveForensics/FraudBusterExample.git


Navigate to the cloned directory and install dependencies:

cd FraudBusterExample
npm install


Start the application:

npm start

## Usage

To integrate the Fraud Buster API effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Fill out the payment form** with the necessary transaction details.
2. **Click 'Submit Payment'** to dispatch the data to the Fraud Buster API.
3. **Review the risk score** to determine the transaction risk:
   -  `Green`: Proceed to payment (Risk Score < 50).
   -  `Yellow`: Review payment (Risk Score between 50 and 65).
   -  `Red`: Risky payment (Risk Score > 65).

## Integration Guide

Follow these steps to integrate the Fraud Buster API into your existing payment system:

1. **Set up the React environment**: Confirm that your project is equipped with React and all necessary dependencies.
2. **Import and use the custom hook**: Utilize `useApi`, a custom React hook, for seamless interaction with the Fraud Buster API. Incorporate this hook within your payment form component.
3. **Handle form submission**: Adapt the form's submission logic to include the current time and employ the `postData` function offered by `useApi`.
4. **Display risk assessment results**: Execute conditional rendering based on the API's feedback to enlighten users about the transaction's risk score.
